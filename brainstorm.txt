steps to do from now:

- parse response text to get the min price
- repeat for multiple websites
- store everything in a data frame for neatness
- set up repeating email system:
    - if a price is less than target, add it to invicible profile and send email
    - keep checking, but if 5 prices are less, then stop send all and stop emailing
    - restart checking after 5 mins, make sure that there are no repeats
